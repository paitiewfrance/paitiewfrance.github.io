La Charité-sur-Loire was founded about the seventh century and was originally named Seyr (City of Light). It is located on one of the Paths of Saint-Jacques de Compostelle taken by pilgrims from various points in Europe to the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela. The generosity of the Cluny monks to the pilgrims following the Compostelle Route caused Seyr to be renamed La Charité-sur- Loire.

In 1081 Philippe Auguste authorised the construction of a first surrounding wall, which was strengthened in 1164. These battlements surrounded and protected the wall around the monastery. In the 19th century the town’s growth gradually swallowed up the battlements, which became part of the town itself.
